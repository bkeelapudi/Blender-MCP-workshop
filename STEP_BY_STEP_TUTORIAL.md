## 🔧 **Step 13: Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### 13.1 Asset Not Visible in Blender
**Problem:** Created asset but can't see it in Blender
**Solutions:**
1. **Switch viewport shading** - Press 'Z' and select Material Preview
2. **Check if Blender is open** - Asset appears in current Blender session
3. **Orbit around scene** - Asset might be outside current view
4. **Press 'A' to select all** - Then 'F' to frame all objects

### 13.2 Materials Look Wrong
**Problem:** Materials appear flat or incorrect
**Solutions:**
1. **Use Material Preview or Rendered** - Solid mode doesn't show materials
2. **Check lighting** - Assets include their own lighting setups
3. **Enable Screen Space Reflections** - For metallic materials
4. **Switch to Cycles** - For most realistic material rendering

### 13.3 MCP Connection Issues
**Problem:** "MCP connection failed" errors
**Solutions:**
1. **Check MCP server** - Ensure it's running on correct port
2. **Test connection** - Use launcher option 2 to test
3. **Restart Blender** - Sometimes connection needs refresh
4. **Check integration** - Review integration guide (launcher option 3)

### 13.4 Performance Issues
**Problem:** Blender running slowly with created assets
**Solutions:**
1. **Use Material Preview** - Instead of Rendered for editing
2. **Reduce viewport samples** - Render Properties → Viewport Samples
3. **Close unused scenes** - File → New to start fresh
4. **Simplify materials** - Temporarily disable complex shaders
