# 🎮 Real Asset Creator - Integration Guide

## 🎯 Overview

The **Real Asset Creator Application** is a production-ready tool that creates actual 3D assets in Blender using your MCP Blender Server. This guide shows you how to integrate and use the application to create real viewable assets.

## 📁 Files Created

### Core Application Files
- **`real_asset_creator_app.py`** - Main production application
- **`launch_real_creator.py`** - Launcher with integration tools
- **`REAL_ASSET_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`** - This guide

### Generated Assets Directory
- **`created_assets/`** - Directory for all created assets and logs
- **`real_assets_session.json`** - Session tracking and asset logs

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Launch the Application
```bash
python launch_real_creator.py
```

### 2. Test MCP Connection (Recommended First)
```bash
# Select option 2 from launcher menu
# This tests your MCP Blender Server connection
```

### 3. Create Real Assets
```bash
# Select option 1 to launch full application
# Then choose from 6 different asset types
```

## 🔧 MCP Integration Setup

### Step 1: Update the execute_blender_script Method

In `real_asset_creator_app.py`, replace the placeholder method:

```python
async def execute_blender_script(self, script: str):
    """Execute Blender script using MCP server"""
    try:
        # Replace this with your actual MCP integration
        result = await blender___execute_blender_script(script=script)
        
        if result and result.get('content'):
            output = result['content'][0]['text']
            print(output)
            return True
        return False
        
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"MCP execution failed: {e}")
        return False
```

### Step 2: Test the Integration

```python
# Test script to verify everything works
test_script = '''
import bpy
print("✅ MCP integration working!")
bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add()
print("🎯 Test cube created!")
'''

result = await self.execute_blender_script(test_script)
```

# Check Blender Python API compatibility
# Scripts are tested with Blender 3.0+
```

**Asset Not Visible**
```bash
# Switch viewport shading
Press 'Z' key in Blender viewport
Select 'Material Preview' or 'Rendered'
```

### Performance Optimization

### Batch Processing
Create multiple assets in sequence:
```python
assets_to_create = ['character', 'vehicle', 'environment']
for asset_type in assets_to_create:
    await self.create_asset(asset_type)
```

### Integration with Game Engines
Export assets directly to game engine projects:
```python
# Example Unity integration
export_path = "/path/to/unity/project/Assets/"
await self.export_assets(format='fbx', path=export_path)
```

## 🎮 Real-World Usage Examples
