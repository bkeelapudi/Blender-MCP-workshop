## 🎯 Integration with MCP Blender Server

This demo is designed to work with the MCP Blender Server in this repository:

```python
# Example integration
from mcp_blender_server import BlenderMCPServer

# The demo can be extended to use actual Blender execution
# through the MCP server for real asset creation
```

## 🔧 Technical Requirements

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Blender 3.0+** (for actual asset creation)
- **MCP Blender Server** (from this repository)

## 🎮 AAA Studio Workflow Simulation
